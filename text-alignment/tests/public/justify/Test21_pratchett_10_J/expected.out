Many thin-
gs went on
at the Un-
seen Univ-
ersity an-
d, regret-
tably tea-
ching had
to be one
of them.
The facul-
ty had lo-
ng ago co-
nfronted
this fact
and had p-
erfected
various d-
evices for
avoiding
it. But t-
his was p-
erfectly
all right
because to
be fair,
so had the
students.
The system
had worked
quite well
and, as h-
appens in
such case-
s, had ta-
ken on the
status of
a traditi-
on. Lectu-
res clear-
ly took p-
lace, bec-
ause they
were down
there on
the timet-
able in b-
lack and
white. The
fact that
no-one at-
tended was
an irrele-
vant deta-
il. It was
occasiona-
lly maint-
ained that
this meant
that the
lectures
did not in
fact happ-
en at all,
but no-one
ever atte-
nded them
to find o-
ut if this
was true.
Anyway, it
was argued
(by the R-
eader in
Woolly Th-
inking, w-
hich is l-
ike Fuzzy
Logic, on-
ly less s-
o) that l-
ectures h-
ad taken
place in
essence,
so that w-
as all ri-
ght, too.
And, ther-
efore edu-
cation at
the Unive-
rsity mos-
tly worked
by the ag-
e-old met-
hod of pu-
tting a l-
ot of you-
ng people
in the vi-
cinity of
a lot of
books and
hoping th-
at someth-
ing would
pass from
one to the
other, wh-
ile the a-
ctual you-
ng people
put thems-
elves in
the vicin-
ity of in-
ns and ta-
verns for
exactly t-
he same r-
eason.
