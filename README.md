# Java Lab

A collection of Java applications ranging from a finite state machine interpreter to a vector drawing application.



### Installation and Setup
1. **Install Java:**

Make sure a version of Java is installed on your system. Run `java --version` to check if you have it installed. If not, simply install java on your operating system. For instance, on macOS type:
```bash
brew install java
```
Each application has their own `README` file. Look under usage to see how to compile and run each application separately. The example below shows you how to complie and run the P2P file sharing application.

2. **Compile Java from Source:**

The application can be compiled and ran using the following commands inside the project folders `/src` directory.
```bash
cd p2p-file-sharing/src
javac FileShareMain.java
```
3. **Run the Compiled Program:**
```bash
java FileShareMain
```
